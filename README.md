    <h1>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h1>
    <p>This is a simple implementation of the classic game "rock-paper-scissors" in Python.</p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>To play the game, simply run the "rps_game.py" file in a Python interpreter. You will be prompted to make your move by entering "rock", "paper", or "scissors" (without quotes) when prompted. The computer will then make its move, and the winner will be determined according to the game's rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rock beats scissors</li>
        <li>Paper beats rock</li>
        <li>Scissors beats paper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If both the player and the computer choose the same move, it is a tie.</p>
    <h2>HTML Version</h2>
    <p>If you prefer, you can also play the game in a web browser using the "rps_game.html" file. Simply open the file in a web browser and click on one of the three buttons to make your move.</p>
