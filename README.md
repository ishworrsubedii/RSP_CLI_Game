Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game of rock-paper-scissors in Python. The game allows the player to play against the computer and keeps track of the winner for each round.

Requirements
The game requires Python 3 to be installed on the player's computer. No additional packages or libraries are required.

How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the command python rps_game.py to start the game.
Enter your move when prompted (rock, paper, or scissors).
The computer will randomly choose its move, and the winner will be announced.
After the round is over, the player will be prompted to play again. Enter "yes" to play again or "no" to exit the game.
Features

The game allows the player to play multiple rounds.
The game uses simple ASCII art to display the game board and the moves.
The game prompts the player to enter a valid move if an invalid move is entered.
